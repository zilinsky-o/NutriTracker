# NutriTrack

A mobile-first web application for tracking daily food consumption by category.

## Overview

NutriTrack helps users maintain dietary awareness through visual unit tracking with half-circles or quarter-pills. The app allows for tracking consumption across four food categories (Carbs, Proteins, Fats, Vegetables) with maximum unit limits that adapt based on the type of day.

## Technologies Used

- React (via CDN)
- Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
- Browser cookies for local storage
- Babel for JSX compilation in browser

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Select the appropriate day type using the icons at the top:
   - üçÉ Normal Day: Regular nutritional limits
   - üö¥ Sport Day: Higher protein and carb allowances
   - üç∞ Free Meal Day: No maximum limits
4. Use the `+` and `-` buttons to track your consumption for each category (each click adds/subtracts by the configured increment)
5. The app automatically saves your progress in browser cookies
6. View your 14-day history by clicking the "Show History" button
7. Edit past days by clicking the pencil icon next to each day in history view
8. Use the slider to reset today's tracking if needed
9. Toggle dark mode using the switch below the reset slider

## Dark Mode

NutriTrack includes a dark mode feature for comfortable usage in low-light conditions:

- The app automatically detects your system preference on first load
- You can manually toggle between light and dark modes using the switch below the reset slider
- Your preference is saved between sessions
- Dark mode applies to all screens (tracking, history, editing)

## Day Types Explained

### Normal Day (üçÉ)
- Carbs: 2.5 units
- Proteins: 3.5 units
- Fats: 1.0 unit
- Vegetables: 2.5 units

### Sport Day (üö¥)
- Carbs: 4.5 units (increased)
- Proteins: 3.0 units
- Fats: 1.0 unit
- Vegetables: 2.5 units

### Free Meal Day (üç∞)
- No limits on any category
- No red warning indicators

## URL Parameters

NutriTrack supports customizing the application through URL parameters:

### Unit Increment Parameter

Use the `i` parameter to set the increment step size:

```
?i=25
```

This sets the increment value to 0.25 units (instead of the default 0.5 units). This affects:
- The step size when using the +/- buttons
- The visual representation of units (quarter-pills instead of half-circles)
- Number formatting throughout the app
- Weekly balance calculation granularity

### Food Category Customization

Use the `u` parameter with an ultra-compact format to customize the food category limits:

```
?u=25-35-10-25
```

This example sets:
- Carbs: 2.5 units
- Proteins: 3.5 units
- Fats: 1.0 unit
- Vegetables: 2.5 units

All values are multiplied by 10 to eliminate decimal points (2.5 becomes 25).

### Setting Different Sport Day Values

To set different values for Sport Day:

```
?u=25-35-10-25-45-30-10-25
```

The first four values are for Normal Day, the next four are for Sport Day.

### Combining Parameters

You can combine URL parameters to customize both increment size and food category limits:

```
?u=25-35-10-25&i=25
```

This sets both custom food category limits and 0.25 unit increments.

### Notes

- If only 4 values are provided in the `u` parameter, they will be used for both Normal and Sport days
- Free Meal Day always has unlimited units, but will display empty unit indicators based on the Normal Day values
- If no URL parameters are provided, default configuration is used
- URL parameters do not persist between sessions

## History and Weekly Balance

### History Tracking

The app maintains a complete 14-day history, allowing you to:
- See all days within the history limit, even if you didn't use the app on those days
- Retroactively update entries for days you missed
- Visually distinguish between days with and without data

### Weekly Balance

Weekly balance indicators show how your consumption compares to your goals:
- Only considers days prior to today (not counting today's consumption)
- Shows surplus or deficit for each food category
- Only appears when there is a meaningful difference
- Takes into account your day types (Normal/Sport/Free)

## Development

This project is structured in a way that each component and functional area is separated into its own file, making it easier to maintain and extend.

### Adding a New Food Category

To add a new food category, edit `js/config.js` and add a new entry to the `FOOD_CATEGORIES` array:

```javascript
{ 
  id: 'newCategoryId', 
  name: 'New Category', 
  maxUnits: {
    normal: 2.0,
    sport: 2.5,
    free: Infinity
  }, 
  color: '#HEXCOLOR', 
  bgColor: '#HEXCOLOR-LIGHT' 
}
```
